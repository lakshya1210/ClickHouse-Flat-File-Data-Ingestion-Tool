I am developing a bidirectional data ingestion tool that facilitates data transfer between ClickHouse databases and Flat Files. This web-based application provides a simple user interface for configuring connections, selecting columns, and executing data transfers.
Features:
- Bidirectional data flow (ClickHouse to Flat File and Flat File to ClickHouse)
- JWT token-based authentication for ClickHouse
- Column selection for targeted data ingestion
- Data preview before ingestion
- Multi-table JOIN support (bonus feature)
- Progress tracking and completion reporting

I am planning to implement this using JAVA for backend and HTML/Bootstrap and jQuery for the frontend. Help me to build this.

Make 3 directories:
1) Controller:
   - IntegrationController: which will take care of test Connection, flat file schema, ClickHouse schema
   - WebController: which starts the web server

2) Service:
   - ClickHouseService: to handle ClickHouse database operations
   - FlatFileService: to manage flat file operations

3) Model:
   - Define data models for ClickHouse tables and flat file structures

Steps to implement:
1. Set up the development environment with Java, HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
2. Create the directory structure as mentioned above.
3. Implement JWT token-based authentication for secure ClickHouse access.
4. Develop the IntegrationController to manage connections and schemas.
5. Build the WebController to initialize and manage the web interface.
6. Implement services for ClickHouse and flat file operations.
7. Add features for column selection, data preview, and multi-table JOIN support.
8. Ensure progress tracking and completion reporting are functional.

Follow these steps to build a robust data ingestion tool.
